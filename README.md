# Designing-topology-and-implement-routing-algorithm-of-wireless-Network.
This C++ project focuses on the design of wireless network topologies and the implementation of a routing algorithm. The code includes classes for modeling points in the plane, wireless networks, and tools for generating random networks. The implemented routing algorithm is based on compass routing.
## Features
1. **Point Class:**
     - Represents a point in the plane.
     - Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.

2. **WirelessNetwork Class:**
     - Models a wireless network with randomly distributed nodes.
     - Generates a network and builds an adjacency list based on node distances.
     - Implements the XTC (Crossing Trees Control) algorithm for topology control.
     - Performs compass routing from a source vertex to a destination vertex.
       
3. **Loader Class:**
     - Generates random wireless networks using the WirelessNetwork class.
       
4. **Experiments Class:**
     - Provides a set of experiments to analyze network properties and routing.
  
   
## Usage:
1. **Network Generation and Analysis:**
    - Generates wireless networks with varying numbers of nodes.
    - Analyzes the average and maximum degrees of the network before and after topology control.
2. **Compass Routing Experiments:**
   - Runs compass routing experiments on generated networks.
   - Reports paths from a source to a destination vertex.
